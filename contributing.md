Before You Submit an Issue
----------------------------

* This is only for code examples
* If we do another version, it will be for 2.2 LTS, not 2.0 or 2.1
* For tracking and credit purposes, **each request for correction needs to be in it's own issue. If an issue contains 2 or more issues, we'll close it with a request for breaking up into more atomic issues.**

**Editorial Note:** In order to make issues more readily searchable, we will alter titles and descriptions of issues as needed.
